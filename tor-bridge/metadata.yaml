   Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
   traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
   freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and
   state security.

   This charm deploys a Tor bridge, which helps nodes connect to Tor from a
   more restricted network environment.
