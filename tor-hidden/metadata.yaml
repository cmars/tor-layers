   Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
   traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
   freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and
   state security.

   This charm publishes Juju services as Tor hidden services.

   This instance of Tor does not operate as a relay, to avoid leaking
   information that could reveal the location of the hidden service, see
   https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en#three.
