   Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
   traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
   freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and
   state security.

   This charm deploys a configurable Tor relay. By default, this charm relays
   traffic internally for the Tor network but does not permit outbound traffic.
